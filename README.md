Sudoku solver using backtracking.

End goal is to use a graphics lib to visualise each seperate branch in the recursion tree to better grasp the essence of backtracking

TO RUN THIS YOU NEED THE FOLLOWING:

  1. Python installed on your machine
  2. The graphics library "pygame" for the visualiser
       To install pygame:
         1. Open a command prompt as administrator
         2. Type the following into the shell : "python -m pip install pygame"
         3. Wait for installation to finish

There. Now you can run the code. As long as you give it a valid sudoku.
